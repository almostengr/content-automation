# Social Media Automation

Automate workflow with content posted on website, YouTube, and social media platforms

The automation would allow me to post content on my website [thealmostengineer.com](thealmostengineer.com)
or on my YouTube Channel. Then this automation would periodically check both of those 
platforms and if new content is found, then post it on my Instagram and Twitter accounts.
